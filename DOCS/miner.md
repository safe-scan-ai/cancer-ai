# Miner Script Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the miner script, its functionality, requirements, and usage instructions.

## Overview

The miner script is designed to manage models, evaluate them locally, and upload them to HuggingFace, as well as submit models to validators within a specified network.

Key features of the script include:

- **Local Model Evaluation**: Allows you to evaluate models against a dataset locally.
- **HuggingFace Upload**: Compresses and uploads models and code to HuggingFace.
- **Model Submission to Validators**: Saves model information in the metagraph, enabling validators to test the models.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10**: The script is written in Python and requires Python 3.10 to run.
- **Virtual Environment**: It's recommended to run the script within a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
- **8GB RAM**: minimum required operating memory for testing (evaluate) machine learning model locally

## Installation

1. **Clone repository**

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:safe-scan-ai/cancer-ai.git
    cd cancer-ai
    ```

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**

    ```bash
    virtualenv venv --python=3.10
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

1. **Install Required Python Packages**

    Install any required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Registering miner on the subnet

If you haven't yet created a miner wallet and registered on our subnet here is the set of commands to run:

Create a miner coldkey:

```
btcli wallet new_coldkey --wallet.name miner
```

Create a hotkey for the miner:
```
btcli wallet new_hotkey --wallet.name miner --wallet.hotkey default
```

Register miner on the CancerAI subnet:
```
btcli subnet recycle_register --netuid <Cancer AI subnet id> --subtensor.network finney --wallet.name miner --wallet.hotkey default
```

Check that your key was registered:
```
btcli wallet overview --wallet.name miner 
```

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure the following:

- You are in the base directory of the project.
- Your virtual environment is activated.
- Run the following command to set the `PYTHONPATH`:

```
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:./"
```

### Evaluate Model Locally

This mode performs the following tasks:

- Downloads the dataset.
- Loads your model.
- Prepares data for execution.
- Logs evaluation results.

To evaluate a model locally, use the following command:

```
python neurons/miner.py --action evaluate --competition.id <COMPETITION ID> --model_path <NAME OF FILE WITH EXTENSION>
```

Command line argument explanation

- `--action` - action to perform , choices are "upload", "evaluate", "submit"
- `--model_path` - local path of ONNX model
- `--competition.id` - ID of competition. List of current competitions are in [competition_config.json](config/competition_config.json)
- `--clean-after-run` - it will delete dataset after evaluating the model

### Upload to HuggingFace

This mode compresses the code provided by `--code-path` and uploads the model and code to HuggingFace.

To upload to HuggingFace, use the following command:

```bash
python neurons/miner.py \
    --action upload \
    --competition.id <COMPETITION ID> \
    --model_path <NAME OF FILE WITH EXTENSION> \
    --code_directory <CODE DIRECTORY WITHOUT DATASETS> \
    --hf_model_name <MODEL NAME WITH EXTENSION> \
    --hf_repo_id <HF REPO ID > \
    --hf_repo_type model \
    --hf_token <HF API TOKEN> 
```

Command line argument explanation

- `--code_directory` - local directory of code
- `--hf_repo_id` - hugging face repository ID - ex. "username/repo"
- `--hf_repo_type` - hugging face type of repository - "model" or  "dataset"
- `--hf_token` - hugging face authentication token

### Submit Model to Validators

This mode saves model information in the metagraph, allowing validators to retrieve information about your model for testing.

To submit a model to validators, use the following command:

```
python neurons/miner.py \
    --action submit \
    --competition.id <COMPETITION ID> \
    --hf_code_filename <HF FILE NAME WITH EXTENSION> \
    --hf_model_name <HF MODEL NAME WITH EXTENSION> \
    --hf_repo_id <HF REPO ID> \
    --hf_repo_type model \
    --wallet.name <WALLET NAME> \
    --wallet.hotkey <WALLET HOTKEY NAME> \
    --netuid <NETUID> \
    --subtensor.network <test|finney> \
    --logging.debug
```

Command line argument explanation

- `--hf_code_filename` - name of file in hugging face repository containing zipped code
- `--hf_model_name` - name of file in hugging face repository containing model
- `--wallet.name` - name of wallet coldkey  used for authentication with Bittensor network
- `--wallet.hotkey` - name of wallet hotkey used for authentication with Bittensor network
- `--netuid` - subnet number
- `--subtensor.network` - Bittensor network to connect to - <test|finney>

## Notes

- **Environment**: The script uses the environment from which it is executed, so ensure all necessary environment variables and dependencies are correctly configured.
- **Model Evaluation**: The `evaluate` action downloads necessary datasets and runs the model locally; ensure that your local environment has sufficient resources.

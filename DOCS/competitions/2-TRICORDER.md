# 🏆 Competition: Skin Lesion Classification Based on Images

## 🎯 Competition Goal

The goal of the competition is to build a lightweight and effective ML model that classifies skin lesions into one of 10 predefined disease classes based on lesion images and demographic data.

## 📥 Input and Output Data

### Input

#### 1. Skin Lesion Image
- **Format**: JPEG or PNG
- **Channels**: RGB (3 channels), no alpha channel
- **Minimum side length**: ≥ 512 px
- **Pixel values**: range [0, 512], dtype=np.uint8

#### 2. Patient Demographic Data
- **Age**: integer in years (e.g., 42)
- **Gender**: "m" (male) / "f" (female)
- **Body location**: integer according to the table below

> **Note**: The model must utilize both image and demographic data.

### Output
- **List of 10 class probabilities**: List[float]
- **Probabilities must sum to 1.0** (softmax)
- **Value range**: [0.0, 1.0]

## 🧬 Class List (order in model output)

| No. | Class | Clinical Type | Symbol |
|-----|-------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | Actinic keratosis (AK) | Benign | AK |
| 2 | Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) | Malignant | BCC |
| 3 | Seborrheic keratosis (SK) | Medium risk | SK |
| 4 | Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) | Malignant | SCC |
| 5 | Vascular lesion | Medium risk | VASC |
| 6 | Dermatofibroma | Benign | DF |
| 7 | Benign nevus | Benign | NV |
| 8 | Other non-neoplastic | Benign | NON |
| 9 | Melanoma | Malignant | MEL |
| 10 | Other neoplastic / Benign | Benign | ON |

## ⚖️ Class Weights

| Class Type | Classes (No.) | Color | Weight |
|------------|---------------|-------|--------|
| Malignant | 2, 4, 9 | 🔴 | 3× (BCC, SCC, MEL) |
| Medium risk | 3, 5 | 🟠 | 2× (SK, VASC) |
| Benign | 1, 6, 7, 8, 10 | 🟢 | 1× (AK, DF, NV, NON, ON) |

## 📍 Body Location List

| No. | Location |
|-----|----------|
| 1 | Arm |
| 2 | Feet |
| 3 | Genitalia |
| 4 | Hand |
| 5 | Head |
| 6 | Leg |
| 7 | Torso |

## 🧮 Evaluation Criteria (100 pts)

| Category | Weight | Max pts | Notes |
|----------|--------|---------|-------|
| Prediction Quality | 90% | 90 pts | Weighted average: 50% Accuracy, 50% Weighted-F1 |
| Efficiency | 10% | 10 pts | Model size (50%) + inference speed (50%) |

## 📊 Score Calculation

### F1-score for class types

```
F1_malignant = (F1_2 + F1_4 + F1_9) / 3  
F1_medium    = (F1_3 + F1_5) / 2  
F1_benign    = (F1_1 + F1_6 + F1_7 + F1_8 + F1_10) / 5
```

### Weighted-F1

```
Weighted-F1 = (3 × F1_malignant + 2 × F1_medium + 1 × F1_benign) / 6
```

### Accuracy
Standard top-1 classification accuracy (percentage of correct classifications)

### Prediction Score (90%)

```
Prediction Score = 0.5 × Accuracy + 0.5 × Weighted-F1
```

### Efficiency Score

```
Efficiency Score = 0.5 × (1 - (S - S_min) / (S_max - S_min)) +
                   0.5 × (1 - (T - T_min) / (T_max - T_min))
```

**Where:**
- **S** – model size in MB
- **T** – inference time for single image (in ms)
- **S_min = 20 MB, S_max = 150 MB**
- **T_min = shortest time in competition, T_max = longest time in competition**
- **Efficiency Score ∈ [0.0, 1.0]**

> **Note**: Inference time will be measured on uniform CPU hardware (no GPU).

### Final Score

```
Final Score = 0.9 × Prediction Score + 0.1 × Efficiency Score
```

## 💡 Additional Notes

- Models may return high probabilities for multiple classes – this will not be penalized as long as softmax is correct.
- Calibration is not required but may improve prediction usefulness.
- Models with size < 50 MB receive maximum points for size in efficiency scoring.

## 🔧 Example Implementation

Example scripts and pipeline available in: `DOCS/competitions/tricorder_samples/`

### Running the example:
```bash
cd DOCS/competitions/tricorder_samples
./run_pipeline.sh
```

### Example structure:
- `generate_tricorder_model.py` - 10-class model generation
- `run_tricorder_inference.py` - Inference script with demographic data
- `example_dataset/` - Sample dataset with images and labels
- `README_EXAMPLE_TRICORDER.md` - Detailed documentation

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Review the example implementation** in `tricorder_samples/`
2. **Understand the input format**: 512×512 images + demographics (age, gender, location)
3. **Implement your model** to output 10 class probabilities
4. **Optimize for both accuracy and efficiency** (model size + inference speed)
5. **Test with the provided pipeline** before submission

## 📋 Submission Requirements

- Model must accept both image and demographic inputs
- Output exactly 10 probabilities that sum to 1.0
- Model size should be optimized (< 150 MB, ideally < 50 MB)
- Include inference script compatible with the evaluation framework
